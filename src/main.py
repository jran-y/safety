#---- in main.py (better to be another file in pycharm) ----------
# Step 0: find P_1 and P_2 as (0,0) and (min_distance, 0). find g1 and g2 accordingly.
# Step 0.5 (optional maybe): use [all_points] to find all points of one/each vehicle at the current time
# Step 1: simulation:
#   for t in range(0, 10000000):
#       [movement]
#       [all_points]
#       [min_dis]
#       [relative_speed]
#       if relative_speed == 0:
#           ... and break
#   calculate d1, d2, dm_n etc.
